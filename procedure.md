# Set Class Parameters
In the **Parameters** section on the left side:

   * You will see parameters for **Class 1** and **Class 2**.
   * Each class has fields to set:

     * Mean values (`Mean X`, `Mean Y`)
     * Covariance matrix values (`Covariance XX`, `Covariance XY`, `Covariance YY`)
     * Prior Probability (the probability of each class before seeing data)

# Adjust Parameters as Desired

* Modify any of the values by clicking on the input box and typing new numbers.
* The means define the center location of each classâ€™s distribution.
* The covariance matrix controls the shape and orientation of the distribution.
* The prior probability defines how likely each class is, used for classification decisions.

# Visualize Classification
* After setting the parameters, the visualization will automatically reflect these changes on the plot canvas (600x600 pixels) on the right.
# Use Buttons to Interact with the Plot

* **Mark All:** Click the **Mark All** button to classify and mark all points in the visualization area based on the current parameters.
* **Clear:** Click the **Clear** button to remove all marks and reset the plot display.
# Interpret the Visualization
* The plot shows the 2D distributions for Class 1 and Class 2 based on your parameter inputs.
* Points or areas marked correspond to the classification regions according to Bayesian decision rules.
